The application has been built using the concept of the custom elements.

The container-application contains all the three applications and in index.html the files have been included through the domain name or through the ip_address.

The project is deployed on the microsoft azure and it is done with the CI/CD pipeline.

For each and every module I have included the file deployment and service which is used for the deployment in micorosoft azure.

The modules also contain the docker file by which you can push the code to the docker hub.
